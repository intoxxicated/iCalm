    <string name="about_us">"iCalm is an app that improves mental health and self-im- provement with some of the existing features that help with that, including time management, journal, reading, adding a personal goal, finding a doctor as well as the main feature.
The global prevalence of anxiety and depression surged by 25% during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, as re- ported by the World Health Organization. To address this, a global investment is needed alongside a commitment to mental health. However, the persistent shortage of mental health resources worsens the situation. Moreover, the stigma surrounding mental illness hinders help-seeking behavior, .leading to reluctance, shame, and isolation.
This personal experience inspired the creation of iCalm, which provides free mental health and self-development re- sources. iCalm stands out from other apps due to its unique approach. Meditation originally was meant to help deepen understanding of the sacred and mystical forces of life. These days, meditation is commonly used for relaxation and stress reduction. Meditation is considered a type of mind-body complementary medicine. Meditation can produce a deep state of relaxation and a tranquil mind.</string>
